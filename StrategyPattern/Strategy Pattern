Strategy Pattern:
1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
2. Program to an interface not an implementation.
3. Favor composition over inheritance.
4. The Strategy Pattern:
Defines a family of algorithms. Encapsulates each one, and make them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.
